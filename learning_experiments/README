Disentangled Relational Representations for Explaining and Learning from Demonstration
========================================================================

This folder contains docker files + python source files for the three different experiments 
performed in the paper:
	
Files related to the model trained on the photorealistic data:
* data_generator_mvae file - loads and prepares the data for the learning process
* train_mvae file - performs the training process 
* net_128x128_mvae file - contains the models being trained
* run_experiments_mvae - used to run multiple training sessions in sequence, each parametrised
by its own parameters

Training is done by running `python src/run_experiments_mvae.py`. Results from each training session
are stored under the result directory specified in the scrip:
* trained model
* training log
* learning curves
* arguments list
